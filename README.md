## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze and enhance the resiliency of the VTA transit network. The project includes:
- Generating the network structure in GML format.
- Exploring key network metrics such as centrality, clustering, and connectivity.
- Visualizing the transit network for better insights.

---

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
/data

- transit_network_inbound_multi2.gml # GML file of the transit network /scripts
- analysis.py # Python script for network analysis (TBD)
- /gtfs_vta # Bus route information includes stops, schedule, and runtime etc.

- ---

## Data

The primary dataset is the **VTA transit network**, which has been converted to a GML file for analysis. Data includes:
- Nodes: Stations/stops in the network.
- Edges: Connections (routes) between stations.
